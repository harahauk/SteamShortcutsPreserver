A testproject for beginning to learn Objective C

This program backs up your shortcuts in Steam to the proper location for storing
application data. When you see that your shortcuts have been removed you can run
this, or you can set it to run on login from the option menu.

All in all a pretty useless slightly more advanced than HelloWorld program ;)
